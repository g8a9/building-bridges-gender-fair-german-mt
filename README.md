Code and data associated with the paper **"Building Bridges: A Dataset for Evaluating Gender-Fair Machine Translation into German."**

## Getting Started

1. Create a new python environment (python >= 3.9 is recommended)
2. Install the minimum requirements from `requirements.txt`

## Data Release

Data is released under the **CC BY 4.0** license. 

- `/data` contains the seed nouns for our Gender-Fair Dictionary and the Multi-Sentence Multi-Domain mentions in Wikipedia and Europarl.
- `/results` contains results for our evaluation of machine-translated passages.

## Experiments

We release several bash and python scripts to replicate our experiments. Head to `/bash` or `/src` to find most relevant details. 

Script names and parameters are mostly self-explanatory, but do not esistate to open an issue to ask for more details (this is the preferred way over email).
